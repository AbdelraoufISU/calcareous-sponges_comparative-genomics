# calcareous-sponges_comparative-genomics
This project aims to address the following key questions regarding a new species of calcareous sponges:
1) its phylogenetic position
2) does it have mt-mRNA editing?
3) how many mt-chromosomes?
4) the mechanism of editing loss (if there are any clues).





To achieve these targets, we first constructed the phylogenetic tree twice: once based on 18S ribosomal RNA and a second time based on 28S ribosomal RNA. The two phylogenetic trees can be found in the following file.

Secondly, we extracted the DNA of the eleven known mitochondrial genes based on the main findings of the following paper : https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26725199/ .                                                We then used these genes to search against our DNA and mRNA assemblies of the new species, extracting the best sequences based on coverage and similarity. These sequences can be found here:
DNA_seqs: Contains the eleven DNA sequences, with each file named according to the gene.
mRNA_seqs: Contains the eleven mRNA sequences, with each file named according to the gene.
